    > This gives us a feature that stores in memory a variable i
    > When it pauses execution the only memory it is taking up is variable i
    > It doesn't have to loop over data again
    > It also protects our counter i. After we run .next() the first time, the lines before
      yield runs (let i = 0) and we enter the while(true) which means we are stuck/kept in that
      while loop because of the yeild unless some condition is met
    > This uses power of closures.  The function* has it's own local scope and no one can alter variable i (ie protected internally)
    
    > We can affect from the outside what happens on the inside by passing arguments in the .next(args)
